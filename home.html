                     list of items you should check depending on the time and season. Some of these parts
                      of your vehicle should be checked regularly, and others only in the long run.
                     Be sure to follow your vehicle’s maintenance schedule and service interval record.
                     Caring for your car and keeping it in proper running order takes a little bit of effort, 
                     but you definitely don’t have to be a mechanical whiz to keep your vehicle running well. 
                     The biggest hurdle is being aware of what needs to be done—and how often—for optimal vehicle upkeep. 
                     By knowing the basics about what your car needs, and when you should perform routine car maintenance,
                      you’ll ensure that your car is in top-running condition.<br><br>

                      As an added bonus, if you can prove that your vehicle has been well maintained, you’ll be able to ask top dollar 
                      when it’s time to resell it. And, of course, it’s important to remember that car maintenance costs, while not always
                       cheap, can ultimately help you avoid expensive repairs down the road.To make it easy to keep track of your car maintenance
                        schedule, we’ve created a simple, downloadable car maintenance checklist to help you keep on top of your automotive maintenance.
                        Your engine’s air filter is what regulates the air that flows into your engine and helps keep out debris and particulate. 
                        By making certain that your air filter is flowing properly, you can improve your fuel efficiency, decrease your emissions, 
                        and help ensure the life of your engine. This can be done easily at home, so check your owner’s manual for instructions and 
                        how often it needs to be changed.
